As such, regulated firms must nominate a person &ndash; usually known as the MLRO &ndash; to receive such reports, along with back-up arrangements in case that person is unavailable. If these arrangements are not in place or are unavailable, you should address the matter with management. If you receive an unsatisfactory response, you should consider using the firm&#39;s whistleblowing procedures.</font></p><p><font face=\"Museo Sans 500\" size=\"2\">Many firms have online facilities that automatically provide a receipt as evidence that you have fulfilled your legal obligations. In smaller firms, an e-mail from the MLRO confirming receipt of your report is typically adequate evidence that you have acted appropriately.</font></p><p><font face=\"Museo Sans 500\" size=\"2\">Once you have made a report, it is up to the MLRO to make a determination as to whether the information should be passed on to the FIU in the form of a SAR. Your firm&#39;s MLRO may then ask for consent for a transaction to proceed. You should not take any steps to complete the transaction until your MLRO confirms that consent has been agreed.</font></p><p><font face=\"Museo Sans 500\" size=\"2\">This is also the point at which your criminal liability for tipping off begins.</font><br />&nbsp;</p><h4><font face=\"Museo Sans 500\" size=\"2\"><font color=\"#be2116\" size=\"5\">Reporting &amp; Data Protection</font></font></h4><p><font face=\"Museo Sans 500\" size=\"2\">Data protection legislation provides for the protection of personal data (particularly sensitive personal data), but it does not prevent firms/persons from making AML/CTF reports.

There is the reputational risk for the firm of negative media attention about a transaction, despite the fact that the firm has asked for consent. There is also the risk that the consent process is mishandled, exposing the MLRO to regulatory censure or prosecution.</font>",

Also, their scope is limited by the amount of data available for each country.
